print(value)


# from math import * (means alll fucntions will be available and be used)
# from math import sqrt as s (here sqrt is converted into a variable as s)


import math 
print(dir(math)) #all types used in math builtin is dispaleyd in terminal


# import (function also works if you wrote something in other file and you want to import one variable for value)
