# Adding slides for mathematicians
add_person_slide("Indian Mathematicians", "Aryabhata (476-550)", 
                 "Aryabhata was one of the first major mathematicians and astronomers from the classical age of Indian mathematics and Indian astronomy. He introduced the concept of zero, approximated the value of Ï€ (pi) to four decimal places, and developed the place value system. He also worked on the approximation of sine tables and contributed significantly to trigonometry.", 
                 "Aryabhatiya and Arya-siddhanta")

add_person_slide("Indian Mathematicians", "Brahmagupta (598-668)", 
                 "Brahmagupta made significant contributions to mathematics and astronomy. He provided explicit rules for arithmetic operations involving zero, formulated the concept of negative numbers, and solved quadratic equations. His work included important rules for calculating the area of cyclic quadrilaterals and the length of diagonals.", 
                 "Brahmasphutasiddhanta")

add_person_slide("Indian Mathematicians", "Bhaskara II (1114-1185)",
